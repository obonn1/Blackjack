# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This console-based Java program allows you to play the classic card game Blackjack against a computerized dealer. This project was created in a few days for my Java full-stack boot camp in the We Can Code It! academy.

## Project Focus

   - Separation of IO from game logic.
   - Familiarization with junit testing and TDD method.
   - Modularization of methods
   - Gain practice with the language and console-based programs in general.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** The goal of the game is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

2. **Getting Started:** Run the `BlackjackApp` class to start the game. Follow the on-screen prompts to play.

4. **Game Flow:**
   - The game begins with the dealer and player each receiving two cards.
   - You can choose to "hit" or "stand" during your turn.
   - The dealer will then play its turn based on a set of rules.
   - The winner is determined by comparing the total values of the hands.

6. **End of Game:**
   - The game ends when a player decides to stop playing or if there's a winner.
